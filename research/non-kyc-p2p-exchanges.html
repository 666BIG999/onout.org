The rise of cryptocurrency has brought about many changes to the financial industry. One of the most significant changes is the emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchanges. Unlike traditional exchanges, P2P crypto exchanges allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another without the need for intermediaries. However, many of these exchanges require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, which can be a hindrance to some users. In this article, we present the results of our research on non-KYC P2P crypto exchanges, grouped by country. We focused on local exchanges or those with a significant user base in one country and identified exchanges in the top 20 countries by population. Our findings reveal the state of non-KYC P2P crypto exchanges worldwide and shed light on the countries where they are most prevalent.
