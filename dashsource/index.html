//Landing soon :)

We are excited to announce our crowdfunding campaign for a new product - a HTML framework for building Web3 admin panel and dashboards. We will be using the launchpad platform and all donations will be in BNB. Please note that this is a donation and there is no guarantee of return on investment. However, we are committed to delivering a high-quality product and ensuring our investors are rewarded for their support.

Analogues of our product include bootstrap which is used by 25.9% sites from the internet. Our framework offers tabs, dropdowns, input HTML, and validation of inputs, as well as wallet connect and other common elements. It also supports multichain and includes a db layer. For whom, it is designed for dap developers to save time and for existing daps to create admin panels.

Our team, onout, has a proven track record in delivering high-quality products, and we are confident that this new framework will be a game-changer in the Web3 space. We also offer a return on investment through sales of licenses, with no more than 50x refund. Additionally, we plan to allocate 51% of crowdfunded funds as liquidity to a DEX.
